Hello there !
This project shows how to make basic parallax effect using HTML, CSS and JS.
This will only work properly when you put your browser on fullscreen mode, if you have a large screen, it may work
fine automatically.
I am completely new to web development, and all the credit for this project goes to "codehal" youtube channel. 
I learnt this new parallax effect from one of his video.
